**Creation of trips** <br>
One of the app's main features; without it, it would not be a planning app. Using Recyclerview and View Holder, created trips are then displayed on the Homescreen.

**Layout / UI design**<br>
Using Figma, I created a UI design prototype. Making sure that the design is clean and modern, while also being simple enough to translate into code. Also responsible of the most of of the layout constraints in Android Studio.

**Creation of profile screen** <br>
To allow for user profile setup and identification, very much possibly needed for future implementations. It allows for storage of user's information such as name and home country and also a profile picture for the user. 

**Set up of firebase storage** <br>
Setting up rules to ensure only authenticated users are allowed to read and write data from the cloud storage. Also set up the standardised path that future implementations will be using when storing of photos and videos are needed

**User Authentication/Log-in/Forget password** <br>
Enabling user to register for an account and authenticate in order to save all of their data in the cloud (Firebase). If a user forgets their password, they can choose to change it by selecting the forget password option.
